## Data processing:
- Source data: a sequence of 1 million numbers (int, from 1 to 100) (14, 45, 77, 1, ...)
- Compress the data so that they take up as little space as possible
- Decompress the data into the original sequence
## Conditions:
- Must be multi-threaded
- Computation must be done on the GPU
